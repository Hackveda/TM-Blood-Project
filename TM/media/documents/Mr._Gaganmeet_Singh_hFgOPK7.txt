Interpretation(s)
BLOOD COUNTS-The cell morphology is well preserved for 24hrs. However after 24-48 hrs a progressive increase in MCV and HCT is observed leading to a decrease in MCHC.
A direct smear is recommended for an accurate differential count and for examination of RBC morphology.
RBC AND PLATELET INDICES-The cell morphology is well preserved for 24hrs. However after 24-48 hrs a progressive increase in MCV and HCT is observed leading to a
decrease in MCHC. A direct smear is recommended for an accurate differential count and for examination of RBC morphology.
ERYTHRO SEDIMENTATION RATE, BLOOD-Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a non - specific phenomena and is clinically useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of
disorders associated with an increased production of acute phase reactants. The ESR is increased in pregnancy from about the 3rd month and returns to normal by the 4th
week post partum. ESR is influenced by age, sex, menstrual cycle and drugs (eg. corticosteroids, contraceptives). It is especially low (0 -1mm) in polycythaemia,
hypofibrinogenemia or congestive cardiac failure and when there are abnormalities of the red cells such as poikilocytosis, spherocytosis or sickle cells.

GLUCOSE, FASTING, PLASMA-ADA 2012 guidelines for adults as follows:
Pre-diabetics: 100 - 125 mg/dL
Diabetic: > or = 126 mg/dL
(Ref: Tietz 4th Edition & ADA 2012 Guidelines)
GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN, EDTA WHOLE BLOODGlycosylated hemoglobin (GHb) has been firmly established as an index of long-term blood glucose concentrations and as a measure of the risk for the development of
complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. Formation of GHb is essentially irreversible, and the concentration in the blood depends on both the life span of the red blood
cell (average 120 days) and the blood glucose concentration. Because the rate of formation of GHb is directly proportional to the concentration of glucose in the blood, the
GHb concentration represents the integrated values for glucose over the preceding 6-8 weeks.
Any condition that alters the life span of the red blood cells has the potential to alter the GHb level. Samples from patients with hemolytic anemias will exhibit decreased
glycated hemoglobin values due to the shortened life span of the red cells. This effect will depend upon the severity of the anemia. Samples from patients with polycythemia
or post-splenectomy may exhibit increased glycated hemoglobin values due to a somewhat longer life span of the red cells.
Glycosylated hemoglobins results from patients with HbSS, HbCC, and HbSC and HbD must be interpreted with caution, given the pathological processes, including anemia,
increased red cell turnover, transfusion requirements, that adversely impact HbA1c as a marker of long-term glycemic control. In these conditions, alternative forms of
testing such as glycated serum protein (fructosamine) should be considered.
"Targets should be individualized More or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for individual patients. Goals should be individualized based on duration of
diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient considerations.’’

HIGH SENSITIVITY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, SERUMHigh sensitivity CRP measurements may be used as an independent risk marker for the identification of individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease. Measurement of
hs- CRP, when used in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, may be useful as an independent marker of prognosis for
recurrent events, in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndromes.
When using this assay for risk assessment, patients with persistently unexplained, marked elevation of hs- CRP (> 10mg/l) after repeated testing should be evaluated for non
cardiovascular etiologies. In Rheumatic and other inflammatory diseases, value of CRP less than 10 mg/l is considered satisfactory. More than 10 mg/l suggests disease
activity. Patients with evidence of active infection, systemic inflammatory processes or trauma should not be tested for cardiovascular disease risk assessment until these
conditions have abated
Hs- CRP levels should not be substituted for assessment of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
Turbidity and particles in the sample may interfere with the determination. Patient samples which contain heterophilic antibodies could react in immunoassays to give a falsely
elevated or depressed result.
Results of this test should always be interpreted in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical presentation and other findings.

CORTISOL, SERUM-Cortisol is the primary glucocorticoid hormone synthesized and secreted by the adrenal cortex. It is essential for life because it regulates carbohydrate,
protein, and lipid metabolism, maintains normal blood pressure, and inhibits allergic and inflammatory reactions. Cortisol is synthesized and secreted by the cortex of the
adrenal gland under the direction of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Increased ACTH levels stimulate cortisol secretion. The increased cortisol levels inhibit CRH secretion, which
subsequently inhibits ACTH secretion. This negative feedback mechanism results in decreased cortisol levels.
Circulating cortisol levels follow a diurnal pattern in healthy individuals. Levels are highest in the morning after waking and lowest in the evening. Disorders of the
hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis override this diurnal pattern. Decreased cortisol levels are induced by either primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. Addison’s disease
is caused by primary adrenal insufficiency due to metabolic errors or destruction of the adrenal cortex. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by pituitary destruction or
failure, resulting in loss of ACTH stimulation of the adrenal gland. Cushing’s syndrome is caused by increased levels of cortisol due to either primary or secondary adrenal
hyperfunction. Causes of primary adrenal hyperfunction are adrenal tumors and nodular adrenal hyperplasia. Secondary adrenal hyperfunction is caused by pituitary
overproduction of ACTH or ectopic production of ACTH by a tumor. Increased cortisol levels are induced by pregnancy and by stress due to depression, trauma, surgery,
hypoglycemia, alcoholism, uncontrolled diabetes, and starvation.
A 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement is the method of choice in the initial screening for Cushing’s syndrome because it provides the best assessment of cortisol production.
Urinary cortisol is not subject to the diurnal pattern of secretion and accurately differentiates healthy persons from patients with Cushing’s syndrome.
Limitations
Circulating cortisol results from patients receiving Prednisolone or Prednisone therapy may be falsely elevated.
Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal
serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be observed.

LIVER FUNCTION PROFILE, SERUM-LIVER FUNCTION PROFILE
Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment found in bile and is a breakdown product of normal heme catabolism. Bilirubin is excreted in bile and urine, and elevated levels may give
yellow discoloration in jaundice.Elevated levels results from increased bilirubin production (eg, hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis), decreased bilirubin excretion (eg,
obstruction and hepatitis), and abnormal bilirubin metabolism (eg, hereditary and neonatal jaundice). Conjugated (direct) bilirubin is elevated more than unconjugated
(indirect) bilirubin in Viral hepatitis, Drug reactions, Alcoholic liver disease Conjugated (direct) bilirubin is also elevated more than unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin when
there is some kind of blockage of the bile ducts like in Gallstones getting into the bile ducts, tumors &Scarring of the bile ducts. Increased unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin
may be a result of Hemolytic or pernicious anemia, Transfusion reaction & a common metabolic condition termed Gilbert syndrome, due to low levels of the enzyme that
attaches sugar molecules to bilirubin.
AST is an enzyme found in various parts of the body. AST is found in the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells, and it is commonly measured
clinically as a marker for liver health. AST levels increase during chronic viral hepatitis, blockage of the bile duct, cirrhosis of the liver,liver cancer,kidney failure,hemolytic
anemia,pancreatitis,hemochromatosis. AST levels may also increase after a heart attack or strenuous activity.ALT test measures the amount of this enzyme in the blood.ALT
is found mainly in the liver, but also in smaller amounts in the kidneys,heart,muscles, and pancreas.It is commonly measured as a part of a diagnostic evaluation of
hepatocellular injury, to determine liver health.AST levels increase during acute hepatitis,sometimes due to a viral infection,ischemia to the liver,chronic hepatitis,obstruction
of bile ducts,cirrhosis.
ALP is a protein found in almost all body tissues.Tissues with higher amounts of ALP include the liver,bile ducts and bone.Elevated ALP levels are seen in Biliary obstruction,
Osteoblastic bone tumors, osteomalacia, hepatitis, Hyperparathyroidism, Leukemia, Lymphoma, Paget''''''''s disease,Rickets,Sarcoidosis etc. Lower-than-normal ALP levels
seen in Hypophosphatasia,Malnutrition,Protein deficiency,Wilson''''''''s disease.GGT is an enzyme found in cell membranes of many tissues mainly in the liver,kidney and

pancreas.It is also found in other tissues including intestine,spleen,heart, brain and seminal vesicles.The highest concentration is in the kidney,but the liver is considered the
source of normal enzyme activity.Serum GGT has been widely used as an index of liver dysfunction.Elevated serum GGT activity can be found in diseases of the liver,biliary
system and pancreas.Conditions that increase serum GGT are obstructive liver disease,high alcohol consumption and use of enzyme-inducing drugs etc.Serum total
protein,also known as total protein,is a biochemical test for measuring the total amount of protein in serum.Protein in the plasma is made up of albumin and
globulin.Higher-than-normal levels may be due to:Chronic inflammation or infection,including HIV and hepatitis B or C,Multiple myeloma,Waldenstrom''''''''s
disease.Lower-than-normal levels may be due to: Agammaglobulinemia,Bleeding (hemorrhage),Burns,Glomerulonephritis,Liver disease, Malabsorption,Malnutrition,Nephrotic
syndrome,Protein-losing enteropathy etc.Human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma.It is produced in the liver.Albumin constitutes about
half of the blood serum protein.Low blood albumin levels (hypoalbuminemia) can be caused by:Liver disease like cirrhosis of the liver, nephrotic syndrome,protein-losing
enteropathy,Burns,hemodilution,increased vascular permeability or decreased lymphatic clearance,malnutrition and wasting etc
TOTAL IRON BINDING CAPACITY, SERUM-Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) measures the blood’s capacity to bind iron with transferrin and thus is an indirect way of
assessing transferrin level.
Taken together with serum iron and percent transferrin saturation this test is performed when they is a concern about anemia, iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia.
However, because the liver produces transferrin, alterations in liver function (such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, or liver failure) must be considered when performing this test.
Increased in:
- iron deficiency
- acute and chronic blood loss
- acute liver damage
- progesterone birth control pills
Decreased in:
- hemochromatosis
- cirrhosis of the liver
- thalassemia
- anemias of infection and chronic diseases
- nephrosis
- hyperthyroidism
The percent Transferrin saturation = Serum Iron/TIBC x 100
Unsaturated Binding Capacity (UIBC)=TIBC - Serum Iron.
Limitations: Estrogens and oral contraceptives increase TIBC and Asparaginase, chloramphenicol, corticotropin, cortisone and testosterone decrease the TIBC level.

FERRITIN, SERUM-Ferritin is a high-molecular-weight protein that contains approximately 20% iron. It occurs normally in almost all tissues of the body but especially in
hepatocytes and reticuloendothelial cells, where it serves as an iron reserve. When needed, the iron molecules are released from the apoferritin shell and bind to transferrin,
the circulating plasma protein that transports iron to the erythropoietic cells.
A low serum ferritin value is thought to be the best laboratory indicator of iron depletion. Virtually all patients with low serum iron and low ferritin have iron deficiency. Serum
Ferritin concentration, when considered with other factors such as serum iron, iron-binding capacity and tissue iron stores is valuable in the diagnosis of iron deficiency
anemia, anemia of chronic infection and conditions such as thalassemia and hemochromatosis that are associated with iron overload. It is particularly useful in distinguishing
between iron-deficiency anemia (serum ferritin levels diminished) and "anemia of chronic disease" (serum ferritin levels usually normal or elevated).
Ferritin is an acute phase reactant. It can be found to be elevated in the following conditions and do not reflect actual body iron stores: 1.Inflammation 2.Significant tissue
destruction 3.Liver diseases 4.Malignancies such as acute leukemia and Hodgkin''''''''''''''''s disease 5.Therapy with iron supplements.
Interferences:
Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal
serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be observed.
MICROALBUMIN, URINEMicroalbuminuria is defined as an increase in urinary excretion of albumin above the reference interval for healthy nondiabetic subjects but at a concentration
that is generally detectable by crude clinical tests such as dipstics designed to measure total protein.the diagnosis of microalbuminuria requires demonstartion
of increased albumin secretion in atleasy two out of three urine samples collected in the absence of infection or an acute metabolic crisis.
It is now considered a clinically important indicator of detiriorating renal function in diabetic subjects..in .diabetic..patients. Regular screening of urinary albumin
secretion is valuable in monitoring both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Screening should comence 5 years after diagnosis in patients with type 1 diabetes and at diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes without proteinuria.
Screening is not indicated in patients with established proteinuria. All the patients with diabetes mellitus should be screened on annual basis upto the age of
75 years.
It is important to consider causes of increased albumin excretion, specially in cases of type 1 diabetes present for less than 5 years. These can include
nondiabetic renal disease, menstural contamination, vaginal discharge, uncontrolled hypertension , urinary tract infection, heart failure, and strenous exercise.

CALCIUM, SERUM-Commom causes of decreased value of calcium (hypocalcemia) are chronic renal failure, hypomagnesemia and hypoalbuminemia.
Hypercalcemia (increased value of calcium) can be caused by increased intestinal absorbtion (vitamin d intoxication), increased skeletal reasorption (immobilization),
or a combination of mechanisms (primary hyperparathyroidism). Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy accounts for 90-95% of all cases of hypercalcemia.
Values of total calcium is affected by serum proteins, particularly albumin thus, latter’s value should be taken into account when interpreting serum calcium
levels. The following regression equation may be helpful.
Corrected total calcium (mg/dl)= total calcium (mg/dl) + 0.8 (4- albumin [g/dl])*
because regression equations vary among group of patients in different physiological and pathological conditions, mathematical corrections are only
approximations. The possible mathematical corrections should be replaced by direct determination of free calcium by ISE (available with srl) a common and
important source of preanalytical error in the measurement of calcium is prolonged torniquet application during sampling. Thus, this along with fist clenching
should be avoided before phlebotomy.
CORONARY RISK PROFILE (LIPID PROFILE), SERUM-Serum cholesterol is a blood test that can provide valuable information for the risk of coronary artery disease This test
can help determine your risk of the build up of plaques in your arteries that can lead to narrowed or blocked arteries throughout your body (atherosclerosis). High cholesterol
levels usually don''''''''''''''''t cause any signs or symptoms, so a cholesterol test is an important tool. High cholesterol levels often are a significant risk factor for heart disease
and important for diagnosis of hyperlipoproteinemia, atherosclerosis, hepatic and thyroid diseases.
Serum Triglyceride are a type of fat in the blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn''''''''''''''''t need into triglycerides, which are stored in fat cells. High
triglyceride levels are associated with several factors, including being overweight, eating too many sweets or drinking too much alcohol, smoking, being sedentary, or having
diabetes with elevated blood sugar levels. Analysis has proven useful in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other
diseases involving lipid metabolism, and various endocrine disorders. In conjunction with high density lipoprotein and total serum cholesterol, a triglyceride determination
provides valuable information for the assessment of coronary heart disease risk.It is done in fasting state.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This is sometimes called the ""good"" cholesterol because it helps carry away LDL cholesterol, thus keeping arteries open and
blood flowing more freely.HDL cholesterol is inversely related to the risk for cardiovascular disease. It increases following regular exercise, moderate alcohol consumption
and with oral estrogen therapy. Decreased levels are associated with obesity, stress, cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus.
SERUM LDL The small dense LDL test can be used to determine cardiovascular risk in individuals with metabolic syndrome or established/progressing coronary artery disease,
individuals with triglyceride levels between 70 and 140 mg/dL, as well as individuals with a diet high in trans-fat or carbohydrates. Elevated sdLDL levels are associated with
metabolic syndrome and an ‘atherogenic lipoprotein profile’, and are a strong, independent predictor of cardiovascular disease.
Elevated levels of LDL arise from multiple sources. A major factor is sedentary lifestyle with a diet high in saturated fat. Insulin-resistance and pre-diabetes have also been
implicated, as has genetic predisposition. Measurement of sdLDL allows the clinician to get a more comprehensive picture of lipid risk factors and tailor treatment accordingly.
Reducing LDL levels will reduce the risk of CVD and MI.
Recommendations:
Results of Lipids should always be interpreted in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical presentation and other findings.
NON FASTING LIPID PROFILE includes Total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol and calculated non-HDL Cholesterol. It does not include triglycerides and may be best used in
patients for whom fasting is difficult.
SERUM BLOOD UREA NITROGEN-Causes of Increased levels
Pre renal
• High protein diet, Increased protein catabolism, GI haemorrhage, Cortisol, Dehydration, CHF Renal
• Renal Failure
Post Renal
• Malignancy, Nephrolithiasis, Prostatism
Causes of decreased levels

CREATININE, SERUM-Higher than normal level may be due to:
• Blockage in the urinary tract
• Kidney problems, such as kidney damage or failure, infection, or reduced blood flow
• Loss of body fluid (dehydration)
• Muscle problems, such as breakdown of muscle fibers
• Problems during pregnancy, such as seizures (eclampsia)), or high blood pressure caused by pregnancy (preeclampsia)
Lower than normal level may be due to:
• Myasthenia Gravis
• Muscular dystrophy

is common in vomiting, diarrhea, alcoholism, folic acid deficiency and primary aldosteronism. Hyperkalemia may be seen in end-stage renal failure, hemolysis, trauma,
Addison''''''''s disease, metabolic acidosis, acute starvation, dehydration, and with rapid K infusion.Chloride is increased in dehydration, renal tubular acidosis (hyperchloremia
metabolic acidosis), acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis associated with prolonged diarrhea and loss of sodium bicarbonate, diabetes insipidus, adrenocortical hyperfuction,
salicylate intoxication and with excessive infusion of isotonic saline or extremely high dietary intake of salt.Chloride is decreased in overhydration, chronic respiratory acidosis,
salt-losing nephritis, metabolic alkalosis, congestive heart failure, Addisonian crisis, certain types of metabolic acidosis, persistent gastric secretion and prolonged vomiting,
URINALYSIS-Routine urine analysis assists in screening and diagnosis of various metabolic, urological, kidney and liver disorders
Protein: Elevated proteins can be an early sign of kidney disease. Urinary protein excretion can also be temporarily elevated by strenuous exercise, orthostatic proteinuria,
dehydration, urinary tract infections and acute illness with fever
Glucose: Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can lead to presence of glucose in urine. Other causes include pregnancy, hormonal disturbances, liver disease and certain
medications.
Ketones: Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can lead to presence of ketones in urine. Ketones can also be seen in starvation, frequent vomiting, pregnancy and strenuous
exercise.
Blood: Occult blood can occur in urine as intact erythrocytes or haemoglobin, which can occur in various urological, nephrological and bleeding disorders.
Leukocytes: An increase in leukocytes is an indication of inflammation in urinary tract or kidneys. Most common cause is bacterial urinary tract infection.
Nitrite: Many bacteria give positive results when their number is high. Nitrite concentration during infection increases with length of time the urine specimen is retained in
bladder prior to collection.
pH: The kidneys play an important role in maintaining acid base balance of the body. Conditions of the body producing acidosis/ alkalosis or ingestion of certain type of food
can affect the pH of urine.
Specific gravity: Specific gravity gives an indication of how concentrated the urine is. Increased specific gravity is seen in conditions like dehydration, glycosuria and
proteinuria while decreased specific gravity is seen in excessive fluid intake, renal failure and diabetes insipidus.
Bilirubin: In certain liver diseases such as biliary obstruction or hepatitis, bilirubin gets excreted in urine.
Urobilinogen: Positive results are seen in liver diseases like hepatitis and cirrhosis and in cases of hemolytic anemia
APOLIPOPROTEIN - B, SERUM-Apolipoproteins are carrier proteins that combine with lipids to form lipoprotein particles, which have hydrophobic lipids at the core and
hydrophilic side chains made of amino acids. There are several classes of lipoproteins ranging in density, from VLDL, or very low density lipoproteins, to VHDL, or very high
density lipoproteins. There are nine different apolipoproteins that are found in human body, and they can act as signals, that cause lipoproteins to act on certain tissues or
that activate enzymes that act on those lipoproteins
Apolipoprotein B (Apo B) is a major protein component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) comprising >90% of the LDL proteins and constituting 20% to 25% of the total weight
of LDL. Increased plasma concentration of Apo B-containing lipoproteins is associated with an increased risk of developing atherosclerotic disease.
Abetalipoproteinemia and severe hypobetalipoproteinemia can cause malabsorption of food lipids and polyneuropathy. In patients with hyperapobetalipoproteinemia (HALB),
a disorder associated with increased risk of developing CHD and with an estimated prevalence of 30% in patients with premature CHD, Apo B is increased disproportionately
in relation to LDL cholesterol. Apo B quantitation is required to identify these patients and is necessary in distinguishing HALB from another common lipoprotein abnormality,
familial combined hyperlipidemia . Elevated levels of apolipoprotein B are more powerful indicators of disease than cholesterol or LDL in angiographic coronary artery disease.
FOLIC ACID, SERUM-Folates are compounds of pteroylglutamic acid (PGA) that function as coenzymes in metabolic reactions involving the transfer of single-carbon units from
a donor to a recipient compound. Folate, with vitamin B12, is essential for DNA synthesis, which is required for normal red blood cell maturation. Human obtain folate from
dietary sources including fruits, green and leafy vegetables, yeast, and organ meats. Folate is absorbed through the small intestine and stored in the liver.
Low folate intake, malabsorption as result of gastrointestinal diseases, pregnancy, and drugs such as phenytoin are causes of folate deficiency. Folate deficiency is also
associated with chronic alcoholism. Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency impair DNA synthesis, causing macrocytic anemias. These anemias are characterized by abnormal
maturation of red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow, the presence of megaloblasts, and decreased red blood cell survival.

Since both folate and vitamin B12 deficiency can cause macrocytic anemia, appropriate treatment depends on the differential diagnosis of the deficiency. Serum folate
measurement provides an early index of folate status. However, folate is much more concentrated in red blood cells than in serum so the red blood cell folate measurement
more closely reflects tissue stores. Red blood cell folate concentration is considered the most reliable indicator of folate status.
Methotrexate and Leucovorin interfere with folate measurement because these drugs cross-react with folate binding proteins.
