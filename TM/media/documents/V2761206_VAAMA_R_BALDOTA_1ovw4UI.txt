PCOS - 2.41-17.1
Male-1.43 - 11.6 ng/mL

Interpretation :
Low values may be obtained in females before puberty and after menopause.
IN FEMALES-During reproductive age, follicular AMH production begins during the primary stage, peaks in preantral stage & has
influence on follicular sensitivity to FSH which is important in selection for follicular dominance. AMH levels thus represent the
pool or number of primordial follicles but not the quality of oocytes.AMH doesnot vary significantly during menstrual cycle &
hence can be measured independently of day of cycle.
IN MALES- it is used to evaluate testicular presence and function in infants with intersex conditions or ambiguous genitalia, and
to distinguish between cryptorchidism and anorchia in males.
• Polycystic ovarian syndrome can elevate AMH 2 to 5 fold higher than age-specific reference ranges & predict anovulatory,
irregular cycles.Ovarian tumours like Granulosa cell tumour are often associated with higher AMH.
• Obese women are often associated with diminished ovarian reserve & can have 65% lower mean AMH levels than nonobese
women.
• A combination of Age, Ultrasound markers -ovarian volume and Antral follicle count, AMH level & FSH level are useful for
optimal assessment of ovarian reserve.Studies in various fertility clinics are ongoing to establish optimal AMH concentrations for
predicting response to invitro fertilization.
[This test conducted by Chemiluminescence method].

NOTE: Since Prolactin is secreted episodically, multiple sampling technique (Eg. Pooling equal volume of sera from specimen
drawn at intervals) is advantageous. Any elevated level has to be rechecked with additional pooled sample for confirmation.

Interpretation:
. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone produced by the adrenal gland.
. Serum cortisol is subject to circadian rythm and levels are highest early in the morning and reach a nadir at about midnignt
(in a non stressed subject)
. Circadian rhythm is lost in patients with Cushing's syndrome.
. Various factors such as stress, illness, time of day, drugs, estrogen therapy and pregnancy may alter the results.

Male: 5.46 - 16.20 umol/L

1) Increased levels are seen in deranged Vit B12 metabolism and form an independent marker for risk of thromboembolic
episodes in coronary artery disease.
2) Levels are also increased in homocysteinuria, various neoplastic diseases like cancers of ovary and breast and Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia, chronic liver or renal failure post menopausal state, drug usage and cigeratte smoking.
Patients taking methotrexate, nicotinic acid, theophylline, nitrous oxide or L-dopa can have falsely elevated serum or plasma
homocysteine levels.

any anticoagulated sample is used.We recommend to repeat the test with fresh sample in case the values are abnormal.

PHOSPHORUS :
(End Point)

8.6 mg/dL

2.3 - 4.7 mg/dL

LDH :
(Kinetic)

195.0 U/L at 37'C

135 - 214 U/L at 37'C.

NOTE : LDH is increased in MI,Hepatitis,Pernicious anaemia,Malignant tumors, Muscle disease,Trauma,Pul.Infarction,Haemolytic
disease,Renal disease and various other infections.

C.P.K (UV Kinetic)

55.00 U/L

29 - 168 U/L at 37'C.

C.P.K is increased in MI, Muscular dystrophy, Alcoholic myopathy, Dilirium tremers, Hypothyroidism, I.M.Infection,Exercise,
pulmonary infection etc. Ref. Todd VII Ed. Please refer standard text books for paediatric specific age related reference
ranges.

IgG Antibodies to Toxoplasma :
(Chemiluminescence)

Interpretation :
The detection of IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma can be used to show immunity and detect seroconversion. A positive result
indicates the presence of anti-toxoplasma IgG antibodies. To repeat after 8 -10 weeks to see for rise in titre, if necessary.

IgM Antibodies to Toxoplasma :
(Chemiluminescence)

< 0.50 is Non-Reactive
0.50 - < 0.60 is Gray zone
>/= 0.60 is Reactive

0

To repeat the test at a later date to see for rise in titre to R/O disease activity. Values above normal indicates recent exposure
to above antigens. Please correlate clinically since false positive results are known to occur.
Reflex test : PCR Technique for confirmation.

Interpretation :
The detection of IgG antibodies to Cytomegalovirus can be used to show immunity and detect seroconversion. A positive result
indicates the presence of anti-cytomegalovirus IgG antibodies. To repeat after 8 -10 weeks to see for rise in titre, if necessary.

IgM Antibodies to Cytomegalovirus :

To repeat the test at a later date to see for rise in titre to R/O disease activity. Values above normal indicates recent exposure
to above antigens. Please correlate clinically since false positive results are known to occur.
Reflex test : PCR Technique for confirmation.

0.0 - 4.9 IU/ml : Non-Reactive1
5.0 - 9.9 IU/ml: Grayzone
(Equivocal)
>/= 10 IU/ml : Reactive

Interpretation :
The detection of IgG antibodies to Rubella can be used to show immunity and detect seroconversion. A Reactive result indicates
the presence of anti-rubella IgG antibodies. To repeat after 8 -10 weeks to see for rise in titre, if necessary.

Non-Reative - < 1.20
Gray zone - >/= 1.20 - < 1.60
Reactive - >/= 1.60

To repeat the test at a later date to see for rise in titre & to rule out disease activity. Values above normal indicates recent
exposure to above antigens. Please correlate clinically since false positive results are known to occur.
Reflex test : PCR Technique for confirmation.
