D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product, a small protein fragment present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by
fibrinolysis. The product increases in conditions inducing inappropriate fibrinolysis.
This assay can aid in the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) & pulmonary embolism (PE). The test results
should be correlated with Imaging studies.
Elevated D-dimer is seen in hypercoagulability, DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis, DIC (Disseminated Intravascular
Coagulation), recent surgery, trauma or infection.

METHOD : CHEMILUMINESCENT MICROPARTICLE IMMUNOASSAY (CMIA)

Specimen:
SERUM

Comment:
Ferritin estimation is useful in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia and iron overload.
Increased levels seen in hemachromatosis, frequent blood transfusions with packed RBCs and alcoholic liver disease.
Decreased levels seen in heavy menstrual bleeding, poor absorption of iron, iron deficiency anaemia and long term GI
bleed.
Ferritin is an acute phase reactant and thus may be increased with inflammation, chronic infection, liver disease, autoimmune disorders and some type of cancers. Ferritin is not used to detect or monitor these conditions.

Specimen:
SERUM

Interpretation:
CRP is a classic acute phase protien of human serum, synthesized by hepatocytes. The presense of agglutinates indicates concentration of CRP in
the sample equal or graeter than 6 mg/L(above normal), which increase significantly after most form of organic disease, tissue injuries,bacterial,&
viral infections inflamation, maligant neoplasia and disease activity in inflamatory.
