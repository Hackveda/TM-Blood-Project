Vitamin A (All Trans Retinol), Serum

0.3-0.6

(EDTA Blood, Serum)

Remark:
According to WHO guidelines a beginning deficiency in adults is indicated by concentrations between 0.1 to 0.19 mg/l, whereas
concentrations < 0.1 mg/l indicate a minifest deficiency, Concentrations > 1.4 mg/l are considered as toxic.
Description Of Test
Vitamin A is the nutritional term for the group of compounds with a 20 carbon structure containing a methyl -substituted cyclohexenyl
ring (Beta -ionone ring) & an isoprenoid side chain, with either a hydroxyl group (retinol ),an aldehyde group (retinal), a carboxylic
acid group(retinoic acid) or an ester group (retinyl ester) at the terminal C 15. Vitamin A deficiency causes degenerative changes in
eyes & skin, & poor dark adaptation or night blindness (nyctalopia). More serious effects of deficiency are xerophthalmia, in which
the conjunctiva becomes dry with small gray plaques with foamy surfaces (bitots spot), keratomalacia.The skin changes include
dryness, roughness,papular eruption & follicular hyperkeratosis.
Technique: HPLC
Decreased IN
1. Preterm infants specially infants with birth weight less than 1500g (< 30 weeks of gestation).
2. Nutritional deficiency
3. Fat malabsorption, particularly caused by celiac disease or chronic pancreatitis.
4. Hepatic disease or alcohol abuse.
Increased IN
Hypervitaminosis A results as a side effect of inappropriate therapy or ingestion of excess Vitamin A.

Vitamin E (Tocopherol) Serum /EDTA
Plasma by HPLC

10.23

mg/L

5-18

(Serum/EDTA Plasma)

DESCRIPTION OF TEST :
Vitamin E is the nutritional term for the group of naturally occurring tocopherols & tocotrienols that have biological activity similar to
RRR -alpha -tocopherol.
Vitamin E is considered necessary for (1) neurological & reproductive functions, (2) protecting the RBCs from hemolysis, (3)
prevention of retinopathy in premature infants, (4) inhibition of free radical chain reactions of lipid peroxidation.
The signs of Vitamin E deficiency are (1) irritability, (2) edema & (3) hemolytic anaemia.
TECHNIQUE : HPLC
DECREASED IN
1. Premature & Low birth weight infants are particularly susceptible to development of Vitamin E deficiency because transplacental
transfer is poor & infants have limited adipose tissue.
2. Fat malabsorption such as in Cystic fibrosis & chronic cholestasis has been known to cause neuropathy & hemolytic anaemia.
3. Rare genetic disorder Abetalipoproteinemia.
INCREASED IN
Vitamin E toxicity is usually rare & can be due to excess dietary supplementation & may cause Vitamin D & K deficiency by
competing for the absorption.
