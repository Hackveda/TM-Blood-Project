Interpretation
A complete blood count (CBC) gives important information about the kinds and numbers of cells in the blood, especially red blood
cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A CBC helps check any symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue or bruising, you may have. A CBC
also helps diagnose conditions, such as anemia, infection, and many other disorders.
Hemoglobin (Hb)
The hemoglobin molecule fills up the red blood cells. It carries oxygen and gives the blood cell its red color. The hemoglobin test
measures the amount of hemoglobin in blood and is a good measure of the blood's ability to carry oxygen throughout the body.

Therapeutic goals for glycemic control

Fair Control : 7.1- 8.0
Therapeutic action suggested : > 8.0

Note: 1. Since HbA1c reflects long term fluctuations in the blood glucose concentration, a diabetic patient who is recently under good
control may still have a high concentration of HbA1c. Converse is true for a diabetic previously under good control but now poorly
controlled .
2. Target goals of < 7.0 % may be beneficial in patients with short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy and no significant
cardiovascular disease. In patients with significant complications of diabetes, limited life expectancy or extensive co-morbid
conditions, targeting a goal of < 7.0 % may not be appropriate.

HbA1c provides an index of average blood glucose levels over the past 8 - 12 weeks and is a much better indicator of long term
glycemic control as compared to blood and urinary glucose determinations.
Trends in HbA1c are a better indicator of diabetic control than a solitary test.
Low glycated haemoglobin(below 4%) in a non-diabetic individual are often associated with systemic inflammatory diseases, chronic
anaemia(especially severe iron deficiency & haemolytic), chronic renal failure and liver diseases. Clinical correlation suggested

2.High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) measurements may be used as an independent risk marker for the identification
of individualat risk for future cardiovascular disease.
3.Increase in CRP values are non-Specific and should not be interpreted without a complete history.

(Whole Blood,Fluorescence Immunoassay)
Interpretation :
1.D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product, a small protein fragment present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. The product increases
in conditions inducing inappropriate fibrinolysis.
2.This assay can aid in the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) & pulmonary embolism (PE). The test results should be correlated with Imaging
studies (e.g. Colour Doppler). The negative predictive value (NPV) with a cut off of 0.5 μg/ml is 95 to 100% for DVT & PE.
3.Elevated D-dimer is seen in hypercoagulability, DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis, DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation), recent surgery, trauma or
infection.
Limitations:
1.False Negative: Anticoagulant therapy
2.False Positive: Elderly,Liver disease,Pregnancy, Eclampsia,Heart disease,Rheumatoid arthritis, Some cancers, High triglycerides,Hemolysis, Lipemia,

LDH(Serum)*

DGKCH Method
Interpretation :

269.0

U/L

<247.0

Lactate dehydrogenase, an NAD+ oxidoreductase, catalyses the reversible oxidation of L-lactate to pyruvate using NAD+ as a hydrogen acceptor. It is present in all cells of the
body and is invariably found only in the cytoplasm of the cell.The total LDH measurable in serum consists of the activities of the 5 isoenzymes LDH-1 to LDH-5 which are
differentiated on the basis of their subunit composition. Because the concentration of LDH in the tissues is 500 times higher than that in plasma, damage to even a small
amount of tissue can lead to a significant increase in the activity of LDH in serum. High specific activities of the enzyme are found in the liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal
muscle, kidneys and erythrocytes.
Myocardial infarction is usually associated with a 3-4 fold elevation of total LDH; similar increases in LDH can occur in myocarditis, cardiac dysrhythmias, electrical
cardioversion and prosthetic valve replacement. After prosthetic valve replacement there is a close correlation between the LDH level and shortened erythrocyte survival time.
Determination of LDH is therefore a reliable method for quantification of the extent of haemolysis. Elevations of LDH activity are observed in liver damage, but these
elevations are not as great as the increases in aminotransferase activity. Elevations are especially high (10 times upper limit of normal) in toxic hepatitis with jaundice; slightly
lower levels are observed in viral hepatitis and infectious mononucleosis. The LDH/AST ratio can be used to differentiate between prehepatic jaundice caused by haemolysis or
dyserythropoiesis from hepatic jaundice. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy elevations of LDH activity are found years before the appearance of clinical symptoms, in the
course of the disease the activity can increase approximately 5 fold.

Interleukin$

pg/mL

<6.40

Interpretation :1.Interleukin-6(IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with a wide range of functions.
2.IL-6 production is rapidly induced in the course of acute inflammatory reactions associated with injury trauma ,stress, infection, brain death,
neoplasia ,and other situations.
3.IL-6 concentrations in trauma patients may predict later complications from additional surgical stress or indicate missed injuries or complications.
4.Sequential measurements of IL-6 in serum or plasma of patients admitted to the ICU showed to be useful in evaluating the severity of SIRS ( Systemic
inflammatory response syndrome) ,sepsis and septic shock and to predict the outcome of these patients .
5.IL-6 is also useful as an early alarm marker for the detection of neonatal sepsis.
6.IL-6 also plays a role in chronic inflammation eg. Rheumatoid arthritis(RA)
NOTE: Sample collected in red top plain tube sst can give excessively high result.( REFERENCE-Pre-analytical effects of blood sampling and handling in
quantitative immunoassays for rheumatoid arthritis by Crescendo Bioscience, Inc.,341 Oyster Point Blvd., South San Francisco, CA 94080, United States )
Patients on Biotin supplement may have interference in some immunoassays. With individuals taking high dose Biotin (more than 5mg per day)
supplements, at least 8-hour wait time before blood draw is recommended.
